# Notes:
# - Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# - On macOS you may need to grant Accessibility permissions to the terminal or Python app.
# - On some Linux distros you may need extra system packages (scrot/xclip/xauth) for screenshots or input control.
# - If you are on macOS/Linux and pip still errors about pywin32, upgrade pip: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
