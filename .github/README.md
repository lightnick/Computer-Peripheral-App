# Computer Peripheral App

This application allows you to use your Android device as a remote mouse and keyboard for your Windows computer.

**Note:** This only works for Android and Windows.

## How to Use

### 1. Set up the Server on your PC

First, you need to run the server application on your Windows machine.

1.  Download `RemoteMouseServer.exe` from the project's **Releases** tab. (You can add the link here).
2.  Run `RemoteMouseServer.exe`. The server must be kept running for the app to function.
3.  After running the server, a notification will appear displaying the IP address of your computer.
4.  If you miss the notification, you can right-click the "Mouse Server" icon in your System Tray and select "Show IP Address" to see it again.

### 2. Connect the App on your Android Device

1.  Open the app on your Android phone.
2.  Enter the IP address that you got from the server in the previous step.
3.  Tap "Connect".

You should now be able to control your PC from your Android device.
